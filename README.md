# Project 1: Deal my car

**Project intuition and reasoning:**

Everyone knows that car dealerships (especially used ones) leverage market info against their customers to extract an extremely high profit margin from both their sales and purchases of vehicles.
They will value trade-ins from their customers at no more than around 40% of the car's current market value, and most people will let it go for that price because they think that is their best option.

I decided to take on this project to help people see what price a dealer would try to sell their car for after they accept it as a trade in, so that they can know exactly how much they should ask for when negotiating their trade-in.

**Overview of work done:**

In this project I went through:

- Scraping car data from Kijiji ads posted by dealerships in the Calgary area
- Cleaning the data
- Performing some EDA to identify key features and trends
- Selecting and training a regression model
- Creating a clunky UI for people to see what dealers would price their cars at (will develop a nicer front-end API soon)

Here is an example:
